  <h2>Copyright disclaimer</h2>
  <p>All pictures on this website are taken by me and are my exclusive property (sounds possesive, right?). You want to copy, process, distribute, remix, manipulate, print, edit, adapt, commercialize… my precious work? Make sure to get my written consent before you do so.</p>
  <h3>Personal use</h3>
  <p>You can use, display or print my photographs for personal use under following conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>For personal viewing or display only (so no public or commercial purpose whatsoever)</li>
      <li>As a student for a school report or presentation, as long as proper citation is given (a link to this website)</li>
    </ul>
    In both cases, the image must be presented in its original form and the watermark must be visible. Give credit where credit is due, and if you ask nicely, I might hook you up with a high quality image.
  </p>
  <h3>Free web use</h3>
  <p>You may display my images for free on a website under following conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>The page/website must be free and accessible for everyone (no paywalls or logins)</li>
      <li>The page/website must be strictly non-profit (if you generate revenue from ads, you’re not a non-profit)</li>
      <li>The images must be displayed in their original form, with the watermark intact and visible</li>
      <li>A link to the original image(s) (this website) and a citation of the author must be provided</li>
    </ul>
